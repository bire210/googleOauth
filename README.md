# googleOauth
 Google OAuth is a widely used authentication and authorization framework provided by Google. It allows third-party applications and websites to access certain user data or perform actions on behalf of a user without needing their username and password.


## steps
  1. Go to the **Google Developer Console:** https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard/
  2. Create a new project or select an existing one
  3. Enable the Google APIs:
     ```
      - In your project, navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Dashboard."
      - Click on "+ ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES."
     - Search for the specific Google API you want to use (e.g., Google Drive API, Google Calendar API), and enable it.
     ```
 4. Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials:
    ```
    -In the Google Developer Console, go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials."
    - Click on "+ CREATE CREDENTIALS" and select "OAuth client ID."
    - Choose the application type (Web application, Mobile application, etc.).
    - Configure the authorized redirect URIs where Google will send the user after authentication.
    - These URIs should match the callback URLs in your application.
    - After configuring, click "Create" to generate your OAuth client ID and secret.
    
    ```
